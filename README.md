# Safe and Non-Conservative Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Handling Unanticipated Behaviors of Traffic Participants

## Description

This repository contains the code to reproduce the simulations of the manuscript "Safe and Non-Conservative Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Handling Unanticipated Behaviors of Traffic Participants" by Tommaso Benciolini, Michael Fink, Nehir GÃ¼zelkaya, Dirk Wollherr, Marion Leibold.

## Usage

### Requirements

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to intall required libraries.


### Run files

Change in the main.py file the Start-up section depending on your goals and run the main script with python3.  
The file plot_all.py plots stored data.  
With plots_for_paper.py plots in pdf and png format of defined time steps are generated.  
The file print_statistics_multi_runs.py computes the mean and standard deviation of the run time for multiple runs.  

### Parameters
You can find the used parameters and settings in the following files:
